# Test Manifest for SubsetJuliaVM
# 
# This manifest contains global configuration.
# Test definitions are distributed in each category's manifest.toml.
#
# Test discovery:
# - tests/fixtures/<category>/manifest.toml - category-specific tests
#
# Supported by:
# - cargo test (Rust): fixture_tests.rs
# - julia: scripts/run_julia_tests.jl
#
# All tests must produce identical results in both Julia and SubsetJuliaVM.
